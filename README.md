## CPU, Memory, Disk, Network Benchmarking (C using PThreads) ##
• Developed algorithms in C (PThreads) to benchmark on compute nodes (multi-core) of the Chameleon cluster (Cloud)

• These algorithms were strongly scaled (divided workload size) to reduce the workload per thread and evaluate the performance.

Note: Look for source code in .c/.cpp files.
